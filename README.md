# This Project is a Covid-19 Dashboard built in altair using data from the CDC. 
- The dashboard contains a geomap displaying covid related deaths by county per 500k. 
- The dashboard also contains two layered graphs depicitng the number of cases and deaths by age group perk week as line graphs. 
- The  area charts layered onto the line graphs depcit the percentage of people 18-49 who fall into each vaccination per week. 
# Intstructions: 
- The csv file for Covid Deaths by county must be in the same directory as the code for the dashboard. 
- The data preperation file must be run before the running the dashboard, and does not require any downlaoded csv files to work. 
- The file path location must be changed in the Data Preperation to your specified diretory. Example:  
-         dropbox_folder_path = ('/Users/BaileyGimpel/Dropbox/Visualization Work/Covid-19 Vaccine Efficacy Dashboard/')   
-  Once the three csv files are created from the Data Preperation, then the dashboard code can be ran. 
-  The dashboard file creates an html that can be viewed when the dashbaord code is running.
